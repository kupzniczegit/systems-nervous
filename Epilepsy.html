            <h1>Epilepsy</h1>
			<b><p>Epilepsy is a chronic brain disorder characterized by seizures. 
	it is estimated that 1 in 26 people develop this disorder and it affects 
	all genders, races, ethnic backgrounds and ages.<p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>Risk factors may include age (most common in children and older adults) 
	and family history, but may also include head injuries and brain infections, 
	or trauma. Epilepsy can also be a result of strokes. It is also worth adding 
	that a person with epilepsy can both be caused by dementia or could cause it 
	in the future.<p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>This condition will vary widely. Some may lose awareness during a seizure 
	and some might not. Others might repeatedly twitch their arms or legs 
	(also known as convulsions or spasms) and some might not move at all.<p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>Treatment with medicine or surgery can control seizures but it mostly 
	depends on the person. It should also be mentioned that kids with epilepsy 
	may outgrow their condition with age<p><b>
