            <h1>Parkinson's disease</h1>

            	<b><p>Parkinson’s disease is neurodegenerative brain 
	disorder that causes unintended or uncontrollable 
	movements, such as shaking, stiffness and difficulty 
	with balance and coordination.<p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>While virtually anyone could be at risk of developing Parkinson’s, 
	it usually affects more men than women. Another distinct risk is age. 
	It is highly unlikely for a healthy person under the age of 20 to be 
	diagnosed with this illness.<p><b>
	<b><p>Just like Alzheimer’s disease, symptoms will gradually worsen over 
	time. The most prominent signs and symptoms occur when nerve cells in 
	the basal ganglia (an area of the brain that controls movement) becomes 
	impaired and/or dies. Usually, this part of the brain produces dopamine 
	and without it, the afflicted person suffers from movement problems. 
	The 4 main symptoms are tremors in the limbs or their stiffness, slowness 
	in overall movement and imbalance in coordination. <p><b>
	<b><p>Early symptoms will usually be seen by closest family or friends, 
	where the suffering one will show unusual changes in movement including 
	issues with standing up, mild tremors, different speech patterns, lack 
	of facial expressions or unusual handwriting. <p><b>
