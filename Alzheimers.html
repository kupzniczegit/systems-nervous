            <h1>Alzheimer's disease</h1>
            <b><p>Alzheimer’s disease is a neurodegenerative brain disorder characterized 
	by slowly destroying one's memory, thinking skills, and eventually the ability 
	to carry out the simplest tasks. It is the most common variant of dementia, 
	making up 60-80% of cases.</p><b>
	<b><p>One of the greatest known risk factors is increasing age, however it is 
	not a normal part of aging. Other risk factors include being female, having 
	diabetes, or just having a family history of the condition. It is believed 
	that in order to slow down the development of this disease, a person should 
	engage in logical games like crosswords or Sudoku on a daily basis to keep 
	the brain functioning.</p><b>
            <b><p>Because Alzheimer’s is a progressive disease, it worsens over time. 
	In its early stages, memory loss is mild, but with late-stage Alzheimer’s, 
	the person loses the ability to have a conversation and respond to the 
	environment. On average, a person with Alzheimer’s lives 4 to 8 years 
	after diagnosis but can live as long as 20 years, depending on outside 
	factors.</p><b>
