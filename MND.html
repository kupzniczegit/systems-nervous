            <h1>Motor Neurone Disease</h1>
            <b><p>Motor Neurone disease (MND) is a rare neurodegenerative condition 
	that progressively damages parts of the nervous system. <p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>MND is directly caused by motor neurons that stop working properly 
	and die prematurely (that process is called neurodegeneration). These 
	neurons are in charge of muscle activity like gripping, walking, speaking, 
	swallowing or breathing.<p><b>
	<main>
	<b><p>The symptoms tend to appear on one side of the body, they get 
	progressively worse and take over the other side. Early symptoms include 
	limb-onset disease, bulbar-onset disease and respiratory-onset disease. 
	Later on, the symptoms get more advanced and they will include increasing 
	body paralysis and in some cases insomnia, anxiety, or depression. <p><b>
